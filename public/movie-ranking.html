<h1>The Best Movies According to Ellen</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Como treinar seu drag√£o</h3>
<p>This is a movie about a boy assigned to be a leader of a village full of people who hate dragons.
    But one day this little boy found the most dangerous dragon of all dragons injured, and they became friends. So, after this unexpected encounter, the boy decides that he needs to come up with a plan to change the people's opnions about the dragons.</p>

<h3>O menino do pijama listrado</h3>
<p>This isn't one of my favourites movies, but it definately changed my mind. The movie itself is about World Warm II, when the Jewish people were persecuted and killed. The history is based on two kids who became friends, one of the boys was Jewish and the other was the commander's son. </p>

<h3>How I was before you</h3>
<p>Another movie that makes me cry a lot! The history is about a rich guy, who had a tragic accident and became quadriplegic, and a poor girl who is hired to take care of him.</p>
